# GoAnimate Assets
This is an archive of the once prosporous GoAnimate Asset/Store Recreation. This portion of the project was originally handled almost exclusively by Poley Magik, however many have contributed to this repo since. It's reccomended you look through the commit history of this project if you want to know every single contributor. Most contents have been ripped using tools posted on [this repository](https://github.com/PoleyMagik/GoTools), however it isn't reccomended you use these tools in the present day, as they are not particularly well programmed, nor easy to use. Thank you to all who supported this project in it's lifetime.
